# drfthai
DRF Thai is a prototype webapp that I wrote for Thai language, re-written to use Django Rest Framework.
Originally the data was a hard-coded javascript object, but now it gets stored via DRF to sqlite3 database.
The DRF part is just the DRF tutorial changed from "snippets" to "phrases" (thai phrases).
